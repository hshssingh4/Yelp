# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **20-25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Filters View added to let the user filter the categories for the app.
- [x] Info button added right in the map view if user wishes to check out the details.
- [x] Launch Icon and App Icons are added to make the look and feel of *Yelp* more desirable.
- [x] The color content of the status bar text has been changed to light so it gells well with the app design!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Auto Layout, definitely.
2. Adding static table views.

## Notes

Implementing the map view was a bit tough (specifically the annotations part).
